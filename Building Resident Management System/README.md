# BRMS (Building and Resident Management System)
BRMS is a 3 tier web system using L.A.M.P built for a class project.

## The Team:
Our Group Name for this project is *OutOfTheBoxProgramming*. The Team consists of:

* Matthew Hunt (https://github.com/hmatt33)
* Sean Boyle (https://github.com/seboy96)
* James Bowbliss (https://github.com/JBowbliss)
* Keith Lopez (https://github.com/keithklopez)

## Purpose of System:
The Team is just beginning on the implementation stage of the project. BRMS is a web system built with html,php,and mysql. This web system is meant to use a database and multiple tables to keep track of multiple different buildings, and the residents who live there. This system is meant to be used by the employees of a realestate company, the only ones who will have a valid login is an employee. This system should let the company add/remove/edit a building's information, as well as add/remove/edit a resident's information. The system will allow the user to select a building, and be able to see a list of all residents within that building.
